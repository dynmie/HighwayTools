# MetroHighwayTools

[![that's crazy](https://github.com/dynmie/HighwayTools/assets/41315732/d458e693-fc99-4006-9935-3745dead2d1e)](https://github.com/dynmie/HighwayTools)


A port of [Meteor](https://github.com/MeteorDevelopment/meteor-client)'s and [Lambda](https://github.com/lambda-plugins/HighwayTools)'s highway tools.


You can find a demonstration video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsU_WlwD_mo).

## About
An attempt to add a fully automated highway building robot to Meteor client.
Created because the current highway tools built into Meteor is just plain terrible.


MetroHighwayTools is confirmed to work on 6b6t; I have personally verified it.
