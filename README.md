# MetroHighwayTools

A port of [Meteor](https://github.com/MeteorDevelopment/meteor-client)'s highway tools,
with inspiration from [Lambda](https://github.com/lambda-plugins/HighwayTools)'s highway tools.

### About
An attempt to add a fully automated highway building robot to Meteor client.
Created because the current highway tools built into Meteor is terrible.

### Warning
This addon is not finished! There are bugs, and they are very big. Use at your own risk.
